# Delta Airlines and Competitiveness
## Delta Files Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This was due to several issues, including high fuel costs, rising labor costs, and large amounts of debt.

The airline industry began to make a major fall in September of 2001, due to the terrorist attacks in New York, the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania. These attacks hit the airline industry hard on many fronts. For starters, airlines had to deal with a large payout of insurance monies, totaling over $40 million dollars. Having to pay out these monies to family members and crew took a large toll on the airline industry as a whole. More applicable to Delta though is the drop off in demand following the terrorist attacks. With an immediate drop of over 30% and a long term growth of only 7% year-to-year, revenues decreased sharply and affected all major airlines, including Delta.

A second reason why Delta airlines hit bankruptcy is due to dramatically rising oil and aviation fuel prices. Throughout the 2000’s, oil prices raised dramatically. Delta did not have many aggressive fuel-hedging programs, which led to a dramatic increase in ticket prices. By using fuel-hedging strategies, Delta could have avoided the shock of high fuel costs by creating contracts which resisted the economic downturn and rising oil commodity prices.

Finally, Delta airlines was in a poor position regarding debt. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, many airlines were booming. As as often the case, Delta was prioritizing growth over savings. By investing in new acquisitions and increasing it’s livery, Delta airlines was in a poor position to take on financial hardships. Between rising fuel costs, the effects of 9/11, and decreased ridership, Delta was unable to maintain it’s existing operations. They filed for bankruptcy in September of 2005.

Looking at the same time period, we can see that some airlines actually performed quite well compared to the industry average. For example, Southwest airlines maintained the highest stock market confidence and cash reserves and the lowest debt out of any airline post-9/11. This was thanks to their employee-first attitude, strong fuel hedging programs, and a focus on savings as opposed to acquisitions.

On April 25, 2007, Delta Airlines exited bankruptcy. By Q3 of the same year, Delta had achieved profitability. Operating revenues were also up 8.7% from the year before. A large part of this change had to do with a revision of company strategy. As part of this multi-pronged approach to building back up from their position within chapter 11, Delta focused on expanding capital assets through asset sales and a lower cost structure, increasing ridership. Delta also put more of a focus on international flights, which were less competitive than international flights.

## Innovation and Competitiveness
According to Michael Porter, innovation, competitiveness, and productivity are heavily intertwined. In fact, he states that competitiveness and productivity are essentially equal concepts. Included in the course materials, his speech was from a standpoint of growing wealth from a national standpoint. Essentially, he laid out a framework on which competitiveness and productivity can arise.

On a national standpoint, there are three layers of productivity. First, there is the concept of endowment. This is when a country has a high level of resources which can be leveraged for economic power, for example, the oil industry in Saudi Arabia. Second, is the macro-economic competitiveness layer. This is the supporting infrastructure, including business competition as well as a stable government and access to public resources. Thirdly, a country should have a layer of micro-economic competitiveness. Porter also speaks about the concept of "clusters". These clusters are concentrated pockets of firms within a similar industry and, typically, a close geographic area. These clusters are effective in increasing productivity due to their ability to have a high amount of knowledge of an industry in a particular area, pushing and supporting one another to be more productive and more competitive.

Within a tech cluster, there are also several ways of increasing productivity. The first is by increasing the productivity of companies in the cluster. This is heavily evident in the airline industry example above. As companies began to recover from bankruptcy, they began to push one another towards lower costs and better customer service. At the same time, the "gold standard" companies (in terms of productivity) such as Southwest applied pressure within the cluster to increase the amount of productivity and innovation. A second way to increase productivity within a cluster is by driving innovation in the field. A great example of an innovation cluster is Silicon Valley. Due to it’s very highly concentrated number of computer engineers and tech resources, Silicon Valley has a vast majority of tech resources in the nation. Finally, a cluster can increase innovation by creating new businesses in a field. An example of what sort of new business can be built in a cluster can include those such as a mining company nearby a steel plant or a server farm in the same area as a large tech company. Although separate, they were created from the same cluster and support one another.

According to economist Joseph Schumpeter, there are three pillars to the innovation economy, including evolving institutions, entrepreneurs, and technological changes. These three pillars interact to support the layers of an innovative and productive economy. When combined with the aforementioned concepts of clusters and the micro-economy, these pillars provide the foundation for businesses to take off and grow.
