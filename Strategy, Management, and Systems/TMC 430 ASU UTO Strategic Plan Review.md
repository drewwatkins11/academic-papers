## Abstract

ASU’s UTO is tasked with setting and implementing a strategy for information technologies at ASU. Driven by many external forces, including ABOR oversight, an increasingly tech-savvy student population, and a rapidly changing information technologies environment, the UTO must lay out a strategic vision for the direction of ASU’s IT infrastructure. In the 2012-2016 annual report, UTO identified 25 key tasks across 7 different focus areas.

In it’s strategic plan, the UTO identified several challenges, opportunities, and threats to the IT operations. It also attempted to set out a rough timeline for tasks to be completed to meet strategic deadlines and goals. The strategic plan also makes note of the increasing use of PeopleSoft, ASU’s ERP system across departments, from eAdvisor and student success, to administrative services.

## Introduction

Tasked with overseeing the use of technology across a multi-campus research university environment, The University Technology Office at Arizona State University must operate in a strategic and deliberate manner. Being a part of a large public university, the UTO is held under several constraints, including an externally set budget. Additionally, the UTO has to combine the needs and wants of many key stakeholders, including, but not limited to: students, instructors, researchers, administrative staff, and others. Beyond that, the UTO also is tasked with expanding the reach of the university’s technical resources outside the university in order to expand public interest.

A key part of any strategy, the UTO’s 2012-1016 strategic plan starts off with their mission statement and vision statement, as follows:

**_The UTO Mission_**

*Arizona State University's University Technology Office **provides the highest quality technology based services and systems, in a cost-effective manner,** to support the University's mission and goals as they apply to student learning, academic research and engagement and public service.*

**_Vision Statement_**

> Evidence suggests that we now have the capacity, experience and technological maturity to finally utilize technology as a force multiplier and as a differentiator. Accordingly, we have adopted the following Vision Statement:
>
> *Realize the potential... of information technology to enable and empower students, faculty and staff of information technology to transform and benefit ASU processes of information technology to serve and support the ASU community of our people to become leaders in their profession.*

Looking at their mission and vision statement, we can see that the UTO sets a lofty goal for themselves. The mission aligns closely with their key stakeholders and mentions their constraints of working within the University’s mission and budgets. Their vision is more telling, with the gumption to set out an ideal of being excellent in each of their areas, from empowering students, to building capacity within their employees. Their mission statement could be expanded though, at the moment, it answers a) what they do, and b) who they do it for. The mission statement fails to specifically state the value brought from the UTO (ie. enhancing research, etc) and how they do it (beyond just providing cost-effective technology. As mentioned in Forbes (Hull, 2013), a mission statement should answer four things, of which UTO only touches on two.

1. What do we do?
2. How do we do it?
3. Whom do we do it for?
4. What value are we bringing?

Still, when combined with ASU’s New American University strategic plan, the mission and vision of the UTO is strong. Having a strong mission and vision sets the ASU UTO on a distinct  path towards excelling at it’s task of bring the best technology services to ASU. Beyond just having a vision though, the UTO needed to set out specific goals and a plan for meeting them.

At the helm of the UTO is Gordon Wishan, ASU’s Chief Information Officer. To help steer the UTO in the right direction, Mr. Wishan enlists the help of several different advisory boards. First, the IT Advisory Council is the overarching advisory committee to assist the office of the CIO to set strategy. Consisting of 15 members from across the university, this advisory board serves to provide insight and expertise of how technology is currently, and can be, leveraged across the university to better meet the needs of stakeholders. Additionally, the university wholeheartedly accepts support and insights of a number of faculty members at ASU. This is split into two programs. First, the Faculty advisory board provides insight as to how technology is being used in the classroom and how new solutions can be developed to further engage students in learning and faculty in research. This is accompanied by the Faculty focus group, which serves to evaluate new technology initiatives.

Aside from the various advisory boards, the UTO is comprised of several departments, each with their own area of oversight for providing technological direction across the New American University. Of top hierarchy are the Office of the CIO and the Information Security Office. Supporting them are the offices of: Planning & Programs, Development, Operations & Support, and Academic Technologies.

In addition to internal and university oversight, the UTO is also dependent upon taking into account the goals and strategies set forth by the Arizona Board of Regents. Providing oversight for all three major universities in Arizona, the Arizona Board of Regents plays a key role in creating system interoperability and setting forth a plan to better help students learn and grow. Additionally, the Arizona Board of Regents is a key member in setting the budget for Arizona universities. This external budgetary oversight is important in the fact that the UTO is unable to set their own funding, instead having to rally and petition to create a budget which balances value and cost-effectiveness.

Each of these offices play a key role in accelerating the strategic vision set out by the IT Advisory Council and the CIO. Looking at their strategic plan, we can see that it is divided into several key areas (as decided by the UTO and the ABOR): student success, IT infrastructure, administrative effectiveness, IT security, Academic Technology, research computing, and strategic technology alliances. Looking in more detail, we can then see that there are a number of specific goals for each area specific to how ASU plans on implementing and improving the jointly-decided focus areas.

In tracking these key goals, the UTO employs a system of software called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. In specific, UTO has selected PeopleSoft as their specific vendor. ERP systems are a very valuable part of an organization’s IT systems, as it tracks each "transaction" which happens between the organization and it’s customers and employees, including financials, marketing, support, and other areas. Specific to ASU’s academic purpose, PeopleSoft is also used to track actions and make decisions surrounding class enrollment and student success. By employing big data analysis techniques and predictive intelligence, the UTO aims to further drive innovation surrounding eAdvisor and other academic tools available to students. In addition to providing value to students, the UTO is able to leverage the metrics tracked by PeopleSoft to further their goals by tracking statistics.

For any key goal put forth in the UTO’s strategic plan, they look back to the statistics gathered by ERP to determine usage and/or success. For example, take the UTO’s "Student Success" key focus area. Within this area are four goals, including increasing use of eAdvisor, encouraging more students to look at their DARS, expand the mobile.asu.edu web offerings, and rolling out more software and licesnisng options for key applications used by students. To measure such performance, UTO looks back to metrics gathered by their ERP software. For example, one of the metrics used for the aforementioned focus area is "% Undergraduate

students who actively use eAdvisor tools to track their degree progress". The UTO’s goal is to increase this from the current metric of 79.8% to 95% by 2016. Obviously the massive troves of data gathered by the university’s ERP software is key in tracking and improving such metrics through assessing the impact of initiatives and determining what, if any, changes are required.

Of course, just providing a key long-term metric is not enough to satisfy the needs of a solid strategic plan. Within the pages of the UTO’s 2012 plan is also a section which details the specifics of the goal, states what has been done within the past year, and details *specific* and *measurable* initiatives to be implemented within the upcoming year. For example, using the student success example above, the plan states that in 2011, the "Build a Major Map" tool was implemented to help create specific major maps for students. It then goes on to say that it will build upon these improvements to the eAdvisor system by enhancing BAMM with syllabi and better scheduling tools. Each and every goal is outlined this way, creating a short-term plan to keep the UTO on track.

## Discussion and Recommendations
In review of the UTO’s strategic plan, one can see that UTO has a well thought out strategy and a far-reaching vision for where they would like to be in the next five years. At the same time, there are several things which they could work on to strengthen the plan.

Starting with the strengths of the plan, UTO has done a great job dividing out their vision into manageable Chunks. Especially with the unavoidable bureaucracy and oversight brought forth by the ABOR, ASU’s UTO has created a plan which keeps the organization on the right track. Specifically, the grouping of goals with key areas, combined with specific actions to take in the short term to further those goals, presents the information so nothing is lost within another task or within internal organizational oversights. Each task is specific, measurable, and actionable. Going back to the point about being measurable, another huge strength in this strategic plan is it’s reliance upon metrics gathered from PeopleSoft. Due to this software being implemented, the UTO is able to easily analyze, predict, and measure what needs done stay on track.

Moving on to weaknesses, the UTO’s plan could be improved in several ways. Primarily, the plan does not outline a solid plan for achieving the stated goals. Though rough timelines are laid out, there are no timelines more granular than one year. Additionally, key tasks are not assigned, either to teams, departments or individuals. As a plus, key resources have been laid out well. Though the plan does not go into budget constraints, it does lay out key partners and vendors for accomplishing specific tasks and subtasks within goals. 

The IT world is a rapidly changing environment. As such, there are several things which can be determined as either an opportunity or a threat. In fact, the rapid innovation within IT can be considered both. As mentioned in the strategic plan, the rapid rise of mobile computing and cloud computing services are leading to a significant change in how the UTO will be used on campus. This is leading to both an opportunity and a weakness. An an opportunity, it presents many more services for UTO to present to students. On the other hand, the rapid innovation makes it tough for the UTO to adapt. Even as UTO is implementing their academic success technologies, new services such as Google Classroom are arriving on the field and shaking up education at a rate faster than ever before.

Though the UTO has a great basis on which to work, they could take the strategic plan even further by further setting out strong timetables for implementing projects. They could also improve upon the existing plan by identifying budget constraints and key partners and departments for specific tasks.

## Conclusion
The UTO at ASU has a very solid vision and a detailed strategic plan for getting there. By laying out a system of specific goals and focus areas, as well as key sub-tasks, the UTO is set on a path towards rapid advancement of IT infrastructure.
