## Business Model Canvas

### Value Proposition
Our core value proposition is that Clinics would be able to have access to high-cost equipment without having it purchase it flat-out. Rural clinics often do not have the capital to invest in expensive equipment. Equipment is also not needed as often in a small clinic as in large hospitals. By creating a collective in which to share equipment such as portable MRI machines, CT scanners, and surgical robotics machines, we would be able to help clinics split costs.

In addition to the cost-sharing plan, we would also ensure that clinics still have access to equipment when they need it. By creating portable surgical rooms inside cargo containers and shipping this expensive equipment between many clinics within a 100 mile radius, it allows for us to ensure that the equipment is always close to where it is needed.

### Customer Segment
For our plan to share high-value healthcare equipment in rural areas, we are reliant upon a customer base of many rural clinics within a radius of no more than a hundred miles.

Our goal is to target clinics without access to their own equipment and not within range of larger hospitals. Many areas of the country could benefit from a model such as ours, including rural areas of Texas, the West and Central West regions, Alaska, and parts of the Southwest. The primary determinant factor in our customer segment is finding areas in which these clinics are plentiful and have enough health problems in which to warrant high value equipment.

### Key Partners
For this endeavor to succeed, it would require strong support from key partners, including both clinics, the people financing the equipment (banks and insurance companies). As this would be structured as a non-profit collective, there would also be potential to explore partnerships where payers and equipment manufacturers donate a portion of the funds.

Our key partnership would be with the banks. The equipment would be purchased on loan from the payers. Over time, the clinics would pay off the equipment through their rental fees. Due to the variable nature of needing this sort of equipment, and the lack of a steady consumer base such as that at a more urban hospital, banks would have to be willing to work out a variable payment plan, possibly just taking a portion of costs after overhead. Banks already do quite a bit of charitable work, the trick would be to convince them to support us as they would larger non-profit community betterment programs.

Of course, this endeavor is not just reliant on having the equipment. There is also the need for customers, our clinics. When launching this venture, it is important that we partner with as many clinics as we can in a given geographic area. Without the support of the clinics, we would be unable to create the revenues which we would require to sustain our growth and pay off our bank loans.

In addition to our financiers and customers, we would also have to partner with a shipping company to get the equipment from one location to another. Much of the equipment we need is already portable, such as portable MRI machines. Other machines, such as those for robotic surgery, could be retrofitted into a truck provided we are able to create a sterile and safe environment. To get this equipment from one place to another, it would make sense to partner with a shipping company with experience in this sort of high-value cargo.

Finally, a partnership with equipment manufactures would be a strong plus. Though not necessary, having this partnership could go a long way towards subsidizing the cost of equipment and maintenance.

### Key Activities
After the business is up and running, there are several key activities to consider:
- Transport of equipment from central storage to remote facility - In order to access equipment wherever it may be needed, we need to have a relationship with a logistics company who can transport equipment at a moment’s notice. Equipment will also be stored at a central storage facility when not in use.
- Operation of storage facility - Our business plan depends upon the ability to easily access equipment from any of the location. This requires a central office area which can house equipment when none of the clinics are using it.
- Marketing to rural clinics to sign up members - Marketing will primarily be word-of-mouth, but will also include cold calling to gather members. We will have to have a marketing director who is able to help reach out to all clinics in areas we are trying to build a network.
- Maintenance of equipment - The equipment we will be using is dependent on very tight tolerances and perfect working order in order to perform life-saving operations. In addition to normal maintenance, there will also be adjustments to be made from issues arising from transport. Maintenance will be ongoing and will require a full time staff / technician to stay with the equipment.
- Central business office to manage logistics and money - Even though we will be a collective, we still need to consider the business side of things. Dealing with coordinating logistics without excess transport costs is one huge factor to consider. We also need to have business personnel who can handle accounting and legal issues as they arise.

### Key Resources
Key capital resources are office and storage space for our headquarters, trucks for transporting equipment, and the equipment itself.

Labor resources include drivers for the trucks, maintenance and support personnel for the equipment, and staff for headquarters.

Additionally, having a strong network of clinics can be considered a key resource as having these customers is the backbone of the business.

### Customer Relationships
Key customer relationships include those with our member clinics and those with the shipping company we decide to use. The clinics are important because we are serving them and sharing costs between them.

The clinics should be able to reach out to one another to create the relationships. Marketing would be through word of mouth, as it would be limited to a tight-knit group of doctors in a fairly small number of clinics in a small geographic area. Our goal is to be a collective serving the member clinics, so they should seek us out once they hear about us. At the beginning, we will also cold-call clinics to present the idea and make sure there is a demand before launching the collective.

### Channels
Most of the equipment would have to be transported by truck, for example the large portable MRI machines. Thus, the shipping company must be able to deal with valuable loads such as MRIs.

### Revenue Streams
As a collective, revenue would come from member clinics. They would split the costs of equipment and maintenance, as well as pay for transportation. Currently, clinics either have to invest huge amounts of money in equipment or have to send patients to hospitals a long distance away.

The cost breakdown is as follows: The purchase fee would be split between all the clinics who wish to be involved. Other clinics could use a subscription model after the initial purchase is closed. There would also be a per-use fee which would cover any maintenance and transportation costs. This per use fee prevents bias where one clinic uses the equipment more often but all are paying for it.

### Cost Structure
Our largest cost upfront is purchasing the equipment. Aside from that, most of the costs we will incur will be maintenance related. The equipment is highly sensitive and due to it’s clinical nature, would have to be in top working order. Transportation of equipment is another expense to consider, though would be much less than maintenance costs due to the localized nature of the member clinics.

## Systems Perspective
The healthcare system is a massive monster to tackle and reaching out to small clinics is just one tiny part of it. Still, working in any field of healthcare brings about a number of opportunities to work with various components of the healthcare system. The two areas of the healthcare system I aim to disrupt are the purchasing of equipment and the requirements of using a hospital.

Looking from a standpoint of where HealthShare actually fits in the healthcare system, our aim is to eliminate the requirement for treatment to happen at hospitals. As it exists right now, there are two major stocks, Healthiness and Unhealthiness. For our scope, the system starts with unhealthiness. When a person is unhealthy, they tend to seek treatment. In rural areas, there may only be small clinics, not large treatment centers. People in rural areas go to these small clinics and desire a diagnosis, which requires a test. These tests are done at a hospital. After the test is done, these results are sent back to the clinic, where the primary care physician can elect to prescribe a treatment plan or elect for surgery. If surgery is required, a patient must go back to the hospital, where the surgery is done. This increases the stock of healthiness and decreases the stock of unhealthiness.

The aim of HealthShare is to eliminate the need for a hospital, increasing the value for the patient. By providing expensive diagnostic and surgical equipment to clinics, it allows us to bypass the need for hospitals in the system.

Looking more within the system of the business itself, there is a different loop. Unhealthiness leads to tests, which brings in money from the various payers of the healthcare system. This money is traditionally used to pay for the on-site machines and maintenance at a hospital, which is then used to administer the tests. Once treatment is provided, health is created and there are less patients in the system. In this system, the key stocks are healthiness, unhealthiness, equipment, and money. Tests and treatment are the major activities. Our aim is to insert ourselves between the money and equipment to ease the burden on clinics.

## Innovation Perspective
HealthShare is innovative in many ways, as to our knowledge, nothing like this has been done before as a way of doing day-to-day medical processes in a rural area. The four main areas of innovation are:
- No standard for high-cost equipment in rural clinics / lack of competition
- Empowering clinics to perform more procedures
- Better experience for patients
- New ways to innovate as more money is invested in collective
- Extending treatment options in rural clinics is currently a very small field. The technologies which allow for better treatments in rural environments, such as robotic telesurgery machines and smaller MRI machines, are just now being developed. Seeing as how these technologies are still in their infancy, there is still no standard method of extending these technologies to rural clinics without enough money to purchase them flat-out. Due to this lack of a standard, combined with the small economies of rural areas, the potential for disrupting the traditional model of purchasing equipment is high. Health equipment sharing is definitely swimming within the blue ocean.

The main benefit we will tout, and an innovation to hugely disrupt the existing healthcare system, is the ability to empower clinics to do more procedures on-site. Even though they will be paying for the use of equipment, they will also be getting much more money from insurance companies and other payers, increasing their profits. Providers at these clinics will also be able to be more hands-on throughout the treatment process, eliminating part of the need to refer patients to as many specialists as under the current system.

Because clinics are now empowered to offer more services, it also innovates by creating a better patient experience. Traditionally, patients would have to go from place to place to complete all their services. For someone in a rural area, this could mean constant trips between their primary care provider at their clinic and specialists as urban medical centers as far as several hundred miles away. By bettering the customer experience, it helps encourage clinics to join the collective so that they can offer this convenience and attract more patients.

Finally, due to the nature of the cost-sharing aspect of the business model, it allows for experimentation of how to provide more services at a lower cost. Just a few potential disruptions could include:
- A “co-doctoring” space where equipment is located at a central location, but allows for primary care physicians to pay for access to it
- The ability to fit entire operating rooms into a cargo container for easy shipment between facilities
- Development of new telesurgery protocols, moving it out of experimentation and into the mainstream

As HealthShare would operate as a collective, it would allow for clinics to apply any number of experiments and instantly have access to a pool of testers for their proposed innovations. This sort of experimentation is typically only available to massive clinics which have partnerships with equipment manufacturers and the deep pockets to fund these experiments. Eventually, HealthShare could spin off an incubator for other products based around increasing convenience and lowering the cost of rural healthcare.
