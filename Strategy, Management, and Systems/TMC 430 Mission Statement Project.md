# An Analysis of Two Mission Statements
## Introduction
According to the lecture powerpoints (Waissi, n.d.), the Mission of an organization is the reason for which the organization exists, and what the organization does. The mission statement should be the cornerstone of a company's strategic plan. From the very start, the company should be using the mission statement to set a path for the future of the company. It should also be something that the employees of a company can turn to to guide their day to day decisions and to ensure that they have their customer's best interests at heart.

According to Forbes (Hull, 2013), there are four specific components to a strong mission statement:

1. What do we do?
2. How do we do it?
3. Whom do we do it for?
4. What value are we bringing?

Looking from the perspective of these four questions, below is an analysis of two mission statements. The first example, demonstrating a strong mission statement, is from the HALO Foundation. The second, a poorly constructed mission statement from the University of Arizona Graduate College.

## Discussion

### Strong Mission Statement
**_HALO Foundation_**
> *Our mission is to offer HOPE to the afflicted through the generosity of Service & Charity, involving intergenerational support from seniors to children.  We will respond to individual and group needs and crisis with deliberate thought, prayer, organization, and action.  We serve our mission through HALO programs and support of like-minded organizations.*

The HALO Foundation of Akron, OH is a charity which operates to bring together the community of Akron, OH while supporting those who are underserved. For example, when Hurricane Sandy hit a couple years ago, they send down hundreds of totes to support Tom's River, a town which was hit hard and was underrepresented by aid. Another example is a campaign to help fund the Flight 93 National Memorial when everyone else was concentrating on the destruction in New York.

Looking at the organization's mission statement, it is clear exactly what they do and how they intend to make their claims happen. First, what do they do? They "offer HOPE to the afflicted through the generosity of Service & Charity". This is clearly evident from the beginning of the mission statement and not only mentions that they offer hope, but also that they do so through service and charity. It also mentions that they help both individuals and groups. Second, how do they make their goals happen? According to the mission statement, they do so through deliberate thought, prayer, organization, and action. Additionally, the people executing these claims are intergenerational teams, as well as collaborations with other entities which share the same mission. Answering the third question, the mission statement clearly states that it represents individuals and groups afflicted by crisis. From this, people can see that they respond to events as they happen, as opposed to serving to benefit a specific cause, event, or disease, setting a long term vision. Finally, one can see that the value they provide is in their community based, intergenerational approach. Instead of just raising money for those who are afflicted, they do so through involving bringing together communities, educating youth about the crisis, and partnering them with their elders to encourage networking and mentorship.

Though this is a small organization, it is still obvious what they do and how they do it. Anybody who visits their website or works with them clearly knows who they are helping and how they are making that happen.

### Poor Mission Statement
**University of Arizona Graduate College**
> *The Graduate College provides central support and leadership to serve, oversee, and advance all aspects of the graduate enterprise at the University of Arizona.*
>
> *[http://grad.arizona.edu/about/mission-statement](http://grad.arizona.edu/about/mission-statement)*

Taking a look at an alternative mission statement, one that poorly conveys what the entity exists to do, we have the mission of the University of Arizona Graduate College. Exploring their mission statement from the same perspective, it is not at all clear how they accomplish what they say they will do. The mission starts out strong, answering exactly what the Graduate College does, which is providing "central support and leadership to serve, oversee, and advance all aspects of the graduate enterprise at the University of Arizona". It also readily states who they are doing it for, the University of Arizona. Moving past what and for whom though, they lack a clear statement of how they do what they do and the value they add for the graduate programs. Though it does say that they provide central support and leadership, they do not specify how this support and leadership happens. What is special about how they provide support and leadership? Why can't the individual graduate programs provide support and leadership internally?

In this example, it is obvious that the U of A graduate college thought about what they do and wrote it down. They didn't put any sort of deep thought into their mission however. If they had gone through the process of identifying the specific benefits that they provide to the programs they provide support to, their strategic mission could do a better job reflecting what their purpose is. It would also give them guidance as to how to adapt their organization as it gains and loses responsibilities and member colleges.  

## Conclusion
It is widely known that having a mission statement is a key part of starting a company or creating a business plan. On the other hand, there are few examples of companies which truly excel when it comes to creating said mission statements. By addressing all four components of what a mission plan should convey (what they do, for who, how they do it, and what the value is), businesses can create a statement which tells the public what they stand for as well as providing a strategic path for the company or organization to follow.

The mission statement is an important part of a business plan. As such, when starting a company, the founders should lay out exactly what they intend to accomplish. In addition, as they continue to further grow the company, they should revisit their mission statement every once in a while. Though the mission statement is a guide for how the business should grow, sometimes the business has to realign and adapt to the changing market. Coming up with a mission statement as this happens keeps the business on the right track.
