*Dual-Processing Accounts of Reasoning, Judgment, and Social Cognition*

1. **Describe some of the common principles that cut across all or most dual-process theories. What are the basic concepts shared by these theories? (hint: consider the basic definitions, and consider how they discuss different systems)**
In general, dual process concepts state that both systems one and two are integrated and each shares at least part of the role of many decisions. One common concept is that of preprocessing by system one before being analyzed by system two. Another common concept is the use of either system one or system two for each factor of a complex, multi-factor decision.

2. **What are some of the key concepts/labels and attributes associated with "System 1"?**
System one is the oldest method of thinking, relying upon the animalistic brain and making snap decisions. Common concepts and labels include heuristics, intuitive and impulsive decisions, and animalistic thinking.

3. **What are some of the key concepts/labels and attributes associated with "System 2"?**
In opposition to system1, system two is much more complex than system 1. System two consists primarily of higher cognition, complex thought, analytic reasoning, and conscious decisions.

4. **What are some of the applications of dual-process theories to reasoning processes?**
In relation to reasoning processes, dual-process theories state that as opposed to systems one and two competing to make a decision, they work together. Some ways that this happens are by incorporating both heuristics and analytical thinking depending on different aspects of a decision, or by incorporating biases into an otherwise rational decision.

5. **What are some of the applications of dual-process theories to decision making processes?**
When making decisions, dual process theories can be implied in multiple ways. One example is when system 1 takes over a decision that system two has had much experience in solving. Another example is when a decision is split between systems one and two due to a multitude of inputs, each requiring their own analysis. My final example is when one may answer not the original question, but instead one that is similar yet easier to answer.

6. **What are some of the applications of dual-process theories to social cognition processes?**
In relation to social cognition processes, dual-process theories are regularly used to integrate reasoning of specific questions with heuristics and biases when making decisions. Also, dual-process theories are largely accountable for introspective thinking, where one is analyzing one's own decision making processes and social beliefs.
