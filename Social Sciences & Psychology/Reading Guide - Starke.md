*Decision making under stress: A selective review*

**In what ways are stress and decision making intricately connected? Explain the connections and provide examples. (see p. 2 for a brief introduction, but note that this question is addressed throughout the entire paper)**
Decision making is directly related to stress. When under stress, decision making is made in haste and often not all alternatives are considered. Some examples of stressful decisions are what to do when in a dangerous traffic situation, how to respond when a defender is pursuing a person in football, or deciding on an answer in an exam.

**What topics of research were included in this review of the literature? What topics of research were excluded in this review? How did the authors obtain their sources for the review?**
This paper focused on complex decisions of one or more choices. It excluded research on memory, executive functioning, and operant conditioning. The review focuses on studies which have examined the influence of acutely induced laboratory stress on decision making.

**Summarize the "rational-analytical" and the “intuitive-experiential” systems described in this article (hint: you may want to refer back to the Kahneman paper). What role does uncertainty play in these two systems?**
System one (intuitive-experimental) is basically the gut feeling response. System two (rational-analytical) adds an additional layer to it and is grounded in complex reasoning vs. biases and heuristics. As uncertainty increases, there is a greater reliance on System 1 reasoning. System 2 has very little to go off of, thus there is much less complex reasoning going on.

**What kinds of neuroscience measurement techniques have been used to study the "neurobiological correlates of decision making"? What regions/components of the nervous system seem to be related to the rational-analytical system? What regions/components of the nervous system seem to be related to the intuitive-experiential-emotional system?**
Several neurobiological measurement techniques have been used to study decision making, including fMRI scans, PET scans, and behavioral observations. The intuitive-experiential-emotional system appears to rely primarily on the limbic system and basal ganglia. The higher level rational-analytical decisions are made using more evolved sections of the brain, such as various areas of the cortex. Additionally, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is believed to be involved in emotional integration of decisions.

**Provide a definition of "stress." In laboratory research settings, describe several ways in which stress might be introduced in research participants.**
Stress is something which increases anxiety in response to perceived threats, obstacles, and fears. When in the lab, researchers can use several stressors to manipulate the subjects. Some of these include creating an extreme climate, adding stressful auditory sounds, and inducing worry in people through means such as telling them they will be doing public speaking at the end of the study.

**How does stress affect the quality of decision making strategies or evaluations of risk? Summarize examples of disadvantageous strategies people employ when under stress (see pp. 1234-1239 for many examples).**
Stress rushes decision making processes and leads to poor decisions. There are several mechanisms at work, some of which include:
- Premature Closure - Under stressful situations, one is more inclined to come to a decision prematurely, without taking the time to consider all the options.
- Heuristic Blurring - Under stressful situations, people often use heuristics in a manner which creates biased perceptions as opposed to rational shortcuts.
- Dysfunctional strategy use - High stress situations lead to a reduction in the ability to think critically and use system two resources.

**How do perceptions of stressors (e.g., as a "threat" versus a “challenge”) affects the effects of stress on decision making?**
When a stressor is presented as a challenge as opposed to a threat, it resulted in stronger alertness, faster decision making, and better decisions than if a stressor is presented as a threat.

**Explain the relationships between stress, System 1 processing, and System 2 processing. If you wanted a person to make a "snap judgment" (or a potentially biased judgment), what might you attempt to do? (consider section 5.2 on “Implications”)**
When in a stressful situation, a person is more likely to use system 1 as opposed to system 2 to make decisions, which results in the person making a decision without weighing all the options. If I wanted to make a person make a snap judgement, I would try to create a stressful situation. An example of this could be when a kid asks their parents something after asking them a really big, stressful question.
