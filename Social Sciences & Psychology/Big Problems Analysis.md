### Problem Summary

**Clearly summarize the example problem that will be the focus of your analysis. Provide enough background information so that a person unfamiliar with the problem can understand the relevant details. [5]**
One problem I am facing is that of receiving data from a company to complete my capstone. Without giving out confidential information, the basics of the project are as follows: I partnered with a company, let's call them AP, to work on fulfilling my Six Sigma capstone requirement. In order to fulfill my project, I need to go through the process of collecting data and coming up with the solution to the problem of how to eliminate AP being billed in error. The jist of the problem is as follows: when a client comes into town to train leading up to the NFL combine, they need rental cars and hotel rooms. When they check out, they should be billed directly by the rental company. Instead, AP is being billed by the rental company, resulting in a) additional time being taken to collect payment from the client, and b) sometimes having to absorb costs that are unable to be recovered from the client.

My problem I am focusing on is related to the project itself, not the process happening at AP. I am unable to obtain suitable data from the company in order to complete the analysis stage of my project. This roadblock may end up making it impossible for me to continue through my entire project, resulting in the possibility for me to not become Six Sigma certified.

**Define the concept of a problem representation (also known as a mental model or the "problem space"). As part of your definition, explain several of the key parameters that you might include in a problem representation. [10]**
Mental models are the way you begin assessing a model, creating the problem scope, and figuring out which tools would help assess the problem. They create a concrete set of parameters, including terms, definitions, and operations, that get the problem solving process started. Mental models essentially set up how a problem will be solved, providing the basis for the rest of the problem solving process.

**Provide a representation of your chosen problem. This representation should clearly address the parameters (from #2 above) using your example problem. (Hint: you may want to generate a clear table, diagram, illustration, or a combination). [10]**
There are several parameters which would be used to create a model of my problem. Starting with the key terms and definitions, those parameters are below:
- **AP** - AP is the company I am working with. I need to receive data from them, but communication is breaking down.
- **Project (class project)** - I need to get the data from AP in order to complete my project.
- **Data** - I need data on client billing and time spent remediating errors. The data provided to me is no robust enough to do anything with though.
- **Process (AP's process)** - This process is how they go about reserving the rooms and billing the clients. It is what I am trying to improve upon.

### Problem Structure
**Define the concept of a well-structured problem (also known as a well-defined problem). What are the key features that make a problem well-structured? [5]**
A well structured problem is one which is easy to define. Someone who is trying to solve it should immediately know in what manner to go about doing so. Oftentimes, well-structured problems will consist of math problems or other algorithmic problems.

**Define the concept of an ill-structured problem (also known as an ill-defined problem). What are the key features that make a problem ill-structured? [5]**
Ill-structured problems are different from well-structured problems in that they have more variables and less rules. An example is writing or complex brainstorming. These activities may require multiple areas of knowledge and expertise and employ more than one technique to solve them.

**Explain how your chosen example is either a well-structured or ill-structured problem. Clearly explain how the features of your example are aligned to the features of well-structured or ill-structured problems. [10]**
My problem is very much a ill-structured problem. Because none of the features of my problem can be fit into "tiny little boxes" and figured out using an algorithm, it makes it so I don't have a strong structure of which to go off of when planning out how to solve my problem. One example that shows this is that the data isn't available. This means I can either give up, wait a year, use fabricated data, use an incomplete data set, or any other number of options. This shows that there is little structure and more than one way to do things.

**Define the concept of complexity in problem solving. What are the features that make a problem more or less complex? [5]**
Problem complexity depends upon the number of issues within a problem and how they are interconnected. If a problem has many cause and effect relationships, it is a key cause of complexity. Because complex problems have to take more variables into account, there is a marked increase in difficulty.

**Explain how your chosen example is more or less complex. Clearly explain the ways in which your example demonstrates complexity (or not). [5]**
My problem is fairly complex. The reason why this is a complex problem is because there are many variables all playing into effect. The project is reliant on the data, the data is reliant on the process, my green belt certification is reliant on the project completion, and so on. Each of these has a specific cause and effect which prevents it from being singled out on it's own.

### Problem Types
**Based on the problem type descriptions in the Jonassen paper, explain which problem type best describes your example.**
The problem type which best fits my example is the Strategic Performance Problem. I choose this to be my problem because it is complex and real time. There are many moving parts, and both the company and my class are issues which are time sensitive and highly variable. Additionally, my needs are competing with my company's desire not to provide data.

**Are there other problem types that are relevant to your example? Depending on your chosen problem, it may have features of more than one problem type. [10]**
My problem also counts as a decision making problem. As mentioned earlier, there are multiple paths in which to succeed. I can either scrap it, continue trying to get information which is not available to me, try to work with a different company, or other option. Which of these to do is a very major decision.
