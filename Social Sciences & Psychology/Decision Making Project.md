**Decision Making Project**
*Drew Watkins*

**Part 1: Decision Summary**
**Clearly state the example decision that will be the focus of your analysis. [5]**
My analysis is to decide whether I was going to fly or drive from Ohio to Arizona this summer.

**List and describe all of the choice alternatives (i.e., the options) that were considered when making the decision. [5]**
The first choice was to fly from OH to AZ. The second choice was to drive across the US, staying in a mix of hotels and campsites along the way. The budget for this trip was roughly $500.

**For each choice alternative, please describe all of the key features (i.e., attributes or cues) that you used to evaluate each choice alternative. [5]**
There are several key features that were decided between the choice alternatives. They are as follows:
* Price - *What is the total cost of the trip?* The cost of flying to AZ would be roughly $300. If I were to drive, it would include gas, food for the week, and misc. hotel/campground expenses. The cost of driving would be just above my budget, at about $550.
* Sense of Adventure - *How exciting will the trip be using the said mode of transportation?* I have flown countless times. Though I still enjoy the flights when I hit turbulence on rare occasion, they aren’t that exciting. As for driving, it would include a multi day trip across the country, mostly following Route 66. It would include camping, new foods, new places, and a whole lot of unknown. Due to just how unknown the trip would be, it provides a great sense of adventure, especially when camping in remote areas.
* Dog-friendliness - *Will I be able to bring my dog along?* Airlines ban dogs in cargo during summer months due to heat. I would have no problem taking him with me on the drive. He would be able to stay with my parents if I flew, but having him with me would be a big plus.
* Safety - *How safe will the trip be?* Flying is extremely safe. There is very little chance that anything would go wrong. Also, I know exactly what to expect with flying. Driving is much more dangerous. I would be driving over 2,200 miles, in an older car, and there is a huge potential for things to go wrong. There is also the consideration that theft or assault would be much more likely, especially in some of the areas I would be staying.
* Practicality - *Looking at both the trip and the implications of having a car after arriving, how practical is each choice?* As for transportation itself, the flight would be much more practical. The other factor, though, is that having a car would be very useful for me out in Tempe. As I am working on my capstone project and need to be able to get across the valley in a timely manner, having a car would be very important.

**For each feature, please indicate if it is System 1 or System 2 and explain why you categorized it as either a System 1 or System 2 feature. Provide clear reasons and justifications for your categorizations. [10]**

    <td>The price is something which is calculated in advance and carefully considered. Working with numbers is very much a reasoned exercise requiring research, not a gut decision.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Adventure</td>
    <td>System 1</td>
    <td>There is really no way to quantify adventure. Driving would have many unknowns associated with it, which would make for a higher possibility of adventure. The sense of the unknown is very much a gut feeling, not something that can be researched or quantified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dog-Friendly</td>
    <td>System 2</td>
    <td>Though he is my dog, my mom found it very tough to give him up. There was no way to quantify this feeling and in the end, we both had the gut feeling that I should take him. There was no logic involved in the decision.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Safety</td>
    <td>System 1</td>
    <td>Though more probable driving, things do in fact go wrong when flying. As unsafe travels are possible each way, and there is no way to know in advance, it was simply a gut feeling that driving would be more dangerous.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Practicality</td>
    <td>System 2</td>
    <td>Practicality is a measure which I very carefully reasoned. First, it is much, much more practical to fly than drive, as well as much easier to plan. The pro of driving is that I would have a car in Tempe, as opposed to having to lease one. The practicality aspect of this is huge. The alternatives needed to be carefully deliberated and calculated to determine which method was, in fact, more practical.</td>

**Part 2: Decision Making Process**
**Indicate whether your overall decision making process was more "intuitive" or “deliberative.” Explain your answer. [5]**
I believe that my decision making process was much more intuitive than deliberative. I longed for the sense of adventure which would come from driving and that bias shaped how carefully I considered the other factors of my decision. I was opposed to flying from the onset of when I started deliberating.

**Define the first heuristic that you used. What does that heuristic entail and how does it work? [10]**
Theorized by Zuckerman (1979)[1], the first heuristic I used was the sensation seeking heuristic. The sensation seeking heuristic is based upon the amount of thrill which one receives from a given activity. It states that there are varying levels of sensation which one gleans from an activity and that some people naturally flock towards an activity or experience which provides a high sense of adventure or sensation.

**Define the second heuristic that you used. What does that heuristic entail and how does it work? [10]**
The second heuristic I used is optimism bias. Optimism bias entails a person believing that they are less likely to experience a negative event than others under the same circumstances[2]. Several factors are at work for optimism bias. Two of the main ones are the representativeness heuristic and the singular target focus. The representativeness heuristic shows that individuals tend to compare themselves to a certain stereotype, such as bad drivers, as opposed to the average. The second, singular target focus, stems from the fact that a person knows oneselves better than a group. This tends to lead a person to appeal to one’s own thoughts and feelings, while ignoring the average person.

**Explain how these heuristics were used in your decision making process. Be specific. [10]**
The sensation seeking heuristic was the predominant heuristic used in my decision making process. As I valued the adventure of driving more than any other feature of the choices, I relied heavily on the fact that I would derive pleasure from the seeking of the sensation of adventure and the unknown. This presented itself throughout my planning process, as it provided the bias which steered me away from placing more weight on other features.

The optimism bias heuristic was also heavily used. Whenever I considered the safety aspects of a trip (ex. my car breaking down, my campsite being vandalized at night, getting lost, being bit by a snake, etc.), I assumed that I had a great chance of it not happening to me. This was completely unfounded in any specific evidence, but yet it was a driving force in convincing me to take the road trip as opposed to playing it safe and driving.

**Explain how or whether you used a more systematic reasoning process to either improve (or reject) your initial intuitive, biased, or heuristic process. [5]**
I did not use systematic reasoning to improve upon or reject my initial intuition. Instead, I just used the few features which required reasoning to better support my initial decision to drive. I was trying to find reasons to do what I wanted to in the first place, not improve upon them or find reasons not to take the road trip.

**Part 3: Decision Outcome**
**Describe your final choice. What was the decision you actually made? [5]**
My final choice was to drive as opposed to fly.

**Was it the "right" decision? Explain how the decision resulted in either success versus failure, or satisfaction versus disappointment. [5]**
I believe that my decision was definitely the right decision. The only real advantage of flying was the almost-guarantee of safety. Since I completed the drive safely, I don’t regret my decision. Additionally, I had the benefit of enjoying a great adventure traveling across America.

**In hindsight, what ways could you have made a more rational decision? [5]**
As stated above, I found facts to support my bias that driving would be more enjoyable. If there was a way to exclude that bias, it would make for a much more rational decision. The only way that that could happen, though, would be if someone else made the decision for me and left me no choice.
