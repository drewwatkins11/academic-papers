# Payne (2001) Reading Guide & Answers
*Prejudice and Perception: The Role of Automatic and Controlled Processes in Misperceiving a Weapon*

1. **Describe some of the historical events that motivated Payne’s research.**
Payne's research was fueled by several cases surrounding charges of racial profiling by police. In particular, there was a case in 1999 where Amidou Diallo, an unarmed black man, was shot down by NYPD in a torrent of 41 bullets.

2. **What is priming? How does priming affect perceptions, such as perceptual judgments or the speed (reaction time) of those judgments?**
Priming is the showing of related images / words to get people thinking a certain way, essentially "planting a seed in the mind". One consideration of priming is that it only works for related concepts, not completely unrelated things.

3. **Define the concepts of automatic processes and controlled processes.**
An automatic process is something which is beyond the control of conscious thought. It is typically involuntary and unintentional. On the other hand, a controlled process is something which occurs within conscious thought. It can generally be defined as something requiring increased effortful thought.

4. **Define the concept of a stereotype (or stereotypical judgments). How do these kinds of judgments relate to automatic versus controlled processes?**
A stereotype is a thought or group of thoughts which are formed towards a certain group of people, brands, actions, etc., whether true or not. Stereotypes are quite often governed by automatic processes. This isn't to say they are completely in the domain of system 1 thinking though, as one can think in a rational way to overcome the initial stereotype.

5. **What were the major results of Experiment 1? How did the presence of racial information influence judgments?**
The presence of racial information systematically biases the identification of weapons. People primed with black images was more likely to skew towards detecting a weapon when there was none and detecting an actual weapon faster. This was apparent even when someone was not racist.

6. **What were the major results of Experiment 2? How did racial information, and the additional of a time constraint, influence judgments?**
The findings in study one were even more likely to happen in the second study. There was no time to use system 2, which forced people to make more snap judgements and created even more false positives than the first study.

7. **Can you think of an example from recent events (i.e., within the last few years), where stereotyped thinking might have biased a person’s perceptions of danger/threat?**
One major event in recent years which was the result of stereotyped thinking would be the George Zimmerman incident. As a result of a stereotype against black men wearing baggy clothes, Zimmerman shot a seventeen year old, wielding nothing but a candy bar, in cold blood because he had a stereoype about that kind of person being dangerous.
