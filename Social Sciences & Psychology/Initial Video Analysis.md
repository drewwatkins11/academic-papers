PSY 304 Video Analysis Assignment

**Unintelligent Video** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKQdlXvbWSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKQdlXvbWSU)

*a. Summarize the video. What are the major ideas or events shown in the video?*

In this video, there are a series of events showing behavior which was less than intelligent. The video starts with a Ford Raptor going off a jump. The key point in the video is when they fail the landing and severely damage the truck. The remaining minute of the video consists of small clips which show the reactions of the onlookers.

*b. Briefly explain why you chose this video as an example. Why you feel the behaviors in the video are "intelligent" or “not intelligent”?*

I feel that the behaviors in the video are non-intelligent. This is because the supposed thought process was "lets see if we can go off this jump really high", not “how can I go off this jump and stick the landing”. They showed no signs of thinking ahead to what would happen when the truck stopped flying through the air. I chose this video specifically though, because in addition to showing unintelligent behavior, it also shows my favorite truck.

*c. Looking ahead to our readings about critical thinking, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated critical thinking or non-critical thinking.*

The persons in the video didn’t take a step back and consider their actions fully. Critical thinking goes beyond the decision to do something and considers what the consequences of the action will be and why they are doing it.

*d. Looking ahead to our readings about decision making, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated effective or poor decision making.*

The persons in the video did not fully think through their full actions, thus I believe that they demonstrated poor decision making.

*e. Looking ahead to our readings about problem solving, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated effective or poor problem solving.*

The video I chose did not accurately show any sort of problem, nor the planning process behind the jump. Though not the focal point of the video, the onlookers did have enough sense to call the paramedics, which I deem to be the right response to solving the problem of the injuries obtained during the crash.

*f. Looking ahead to our readings about creativity, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated creativity or a lack of creativity.*

Jumping a truck is not a creative activity, in my opinion. If they had built the ramp, that would have required a great deal of earth moving equipment and forethought, which would add a creative aspect to it. We have no way of knowing if the people in the video built it or not though.

**Intelligent Video** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYTSAuHOHiY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYTSAuHOHiY)

*a. Summarize the video. What are the major ideas or events shown in the video?*

The video for my intelligent example shows the process of setting up a rappel using a figure 8. It walks through how to safely attach oneself to the rope and how to start the rappel.

*b. Briefly explain why you chose this video as an example. Why you feel the behaviors in the video are "intelligent" or “not intelligent”?*

As someone who enjoys climbing myself, I was able to recognize and relate to the thought process shown in the video. The video is intelligent because he takes the time to go through the process completely and respect the necessary safety precautions.

*c.Looking ahead to our readings about critical thinking, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated critical thinking or non-critical thinking.*

The person in the video showed critical thinking in the respect that he was thinking ahead throughout the process and was able to accurately explain, in a clear and concise manner, how to rappel for a newcomer.

*d. Looking ahead to our readings about decision making, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated effective or poor decision making.*

The person in the video demonstrated great decision making. This is because he took the time to think through every step and the consequences of each.

*e. Looking ahead to our readings about problem solving, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated effective or poor problem solving.*

The person in the video did not demonstrate much problem solving, though he probably did pull from the problems he has encountered in the past when relating to his experience in the video. It was more along the lines of regurgitating knowledge already learned.

*f. Looking ahead to our readings about creativity, describe how the persons in the video demonstrated creativity or a lack of creativity.*

Thankfully, the person in the video did not show much creativity. As fun as it is, climbing is a dangerous sport. The person in the video demonstrated a tried and true method in a clear manner, eliminating any room to experiment and run into issues.
