# The impact of instant communication
As a student and young adult in the 2014, I am constantly surrounded by and involved in electronic communication. The way I see it, it is both a blessing and a curse. I have access to more information than ever before; at the same time I feel that interpersonal communication has become much less meaningful than it has been years past.

Access to information is absolutely a very important benefit to come out of this age of instant communication. I remember back in middle school when we would occasionally have a video chat with a class or teacher in a different state via satellite. I found it amazing that that sort of thing was possible. Nowadays, video conferencing is a part of my everyday life. Text messaging is not only instant, but I can see intimate details like when a message was read or where the sender was at. As a student from Ohio who has moved to AZ, all these forms of communication are essential for staying in touch with people back home and add a value to my communications not possible over the phone or paper.

On the flip side of the movement around instant communication, in my personal experience the ability to deeply connect with people in my everyday life has been diminished in a major way. As opposed to actual meaningful conversations, people I text resort to just sending messages for the sake of it. Meaningless, inconsequential, incoherent messages. Just today even, I saw an article on Facebook about how to avoid texting your way to the "friend zone". It recommended no more than 6 words, no emotion, and not even punctuation. What's sad is some people actually follow that, and that flat out embarrass me on behalf of some of my peers.

There's no doubt communication is changing thanks to electronics, but it's not only for the better. Just as information access is rapidly expanding, interpersonal communication skills are going by the wayside. Hopefully this trend takes a turn for the better soon.
