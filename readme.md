In my pursuit of higher education, it is my personal belief that content should be shared to provide a resource for those students who follow in my path. The works created in pursuit of a degree often sit idle and unused following graduation, being put to use neither for personal or community use.

I'll be the first to admit, these are not the end-all-be-all source for the topics covered, and I am by no means an expert. That said, I hope this this provides a resource and a reference for students who may need help with various assignments, concepts, or discussions.

With that stated, this repo contains a collection of papers submitted while in school. (There are some omissions due to inability to share proprietary projects and data. Additionally, this only contains text-based projects.) **These are submitted for purposes of referencing and sharing ONLY, not plagiarism.**
