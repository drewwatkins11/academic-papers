As I write this, I sit in my living room, surrounded by innovations. Most of these innovations are born from the desire to provide entertainment, whether through music or video.

The first innovation I see is a universal remote. Possibly one of the most space-saving innovations to exist in the home theatre, the remote combines the many different individual component remotes that may be lying around. Basically, it has a programmable IR transmitter which can be switched into different modes by selecting various labeled buttons (ex. stereo, TV, DVD). Each of these modes can be programmed by pulling in the coded IR signal dictionaries of an individual remote. Basically, it is the marriage of many different single remotes (ie. it’s parents).

In recent years, further innovations have spurred the development of even such a universally-used  device. For example, there are now a number of remotes which have screens which change based on the selected modes, showing only the "buttons" that are needed. Another example is the usage of macro commands, where one button can turn on multiple components, select the right media, and start playing a movie. Further innovation stands as well , such as better smartphone integration.

Another innovation within the home theatre realm actually stems from taking away features, not trying to cram it with more functions. This product is the Sonos music streaming system. The sonos system is a box which pulls in internet radio for playback on a component speaker system. Sleek, slim, and small compared to traditional amplifiers, this box serves only one purpose: to get music from the internet to one’s stereo. As the music industry shifts from CDs and the radio to a streaming model, it makes sense why this device was born. I would consider it’s parents to be internet radio and traditional stereo receiver systems.

As far future innovation is concerned, devices such as the Rocki already have popped up allowing for existing stereos to join the internet radio movement at a much lower cost than the sonos. The trick going forward is better balancing the different criteria: size, audio quality, price, and compatibility. As this technology matures, it will become more common-place and no longer sacrifice cost or quality as much as today’s options do.
