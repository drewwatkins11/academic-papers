# Odd Combinations
For this assignment, I asked my girlfriend to bring me two random items lying around the house. She brought me a hairbrush and a rubber ducky that my dog uses as a toy.

Starting with the hairbrush, it is large and dark colored. The handle is squishy and has a ribbed texture on it. As you move up to the bristles, they are actually quite comfortable. It has dark plastic bristles with tiny slippery balls on the end, presumably to help it slide across the scalp . It also squishes when you press down on the bristles, so it conforms to one’s head.

The duck on the other hand is a pure play toy in contrast to the utilitarian brush. It is about the size of one’s fist and is bright yellow, with an elvis themed head of plastic hair. It just barely squeaks when you hold it and if floats in the bathtub. My dog loves it. Being a lab, he has a soft mouth. He has yet to destroy it, but he finds joy in running with it, playing fetch with it, and squeezing it in his mouth. It also has the Westin logo on it, as it was advertising the Westin hotel in Vegas.

**Five Products:**
1. A hairbrush with a rubber duck handle, so kids like to use it.
2. A hairbrush which floats in the bathtub.
3. A dog toy that has bristles on it to massage their gums
4. A rubber duck with a grippy handle on it, for playing tug-of-war
5. Hairbrushes with promotional logos on them.

None of the ideas are astoundingly innovative or creative, and most have been done in some way or another. Still, they represent all the different ways two fairly simple items can be combined to form another.

One of the more innovative of the above products is the dog toy with bristles on it. This sort of product is great due to the amount of gum disease and tooth decay that dogs tend to get by the time they are old. By taking big, soft plastic bristles (inspired by the brush) and combining them with a durable chew toy, the dog would be creating healthy teeth every time they play. Ideally, the dog toy would be squishy as well, much like the bed the bristles of the brush sit on. This way the dog would not squeeze too much and injure their mouths.
