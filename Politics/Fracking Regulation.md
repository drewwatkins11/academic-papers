# Issues Surrounding the Regulation of Hydro-Fracking

## Introduction

As an issue which has been on the national spotlight for the past couple years, fracking is becoming a household name, often synonymous with corporate greed, health and environmental concerns, and a massive amount of legal battles. Amidst all this confusion, and causing some of it, is a concern regarding the lack of regulation on the practice of fracking. Why is such regulation being rallied for and what impact it will have on the mining process?

## What Is Fracking?

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of natural gas mining which involves drilling horizontally through large shale deposits to reach pockets of gas which are not accessible through more traditional methods. To start the process, a drill bit goes several thousand feet deep into the earth. It is then directed in a horizontal direction as it reaches a shale formation, or "play". As this shale is too hard to drill through, at this point a mixture of water and several other chemicals are injected into the earth in an attempt to cause fractures to radiate out from the drill bore.

After these fractures are made, the drilling crew then begins the flowback process. The flowback process involves relieving the pressure and allowing the water to rescind from the well, leaving behind a mixture of sand, gelatin, and chemicals. After the water leaves the site of the fractures, natural gas flows behind it and up the well to be transported and refined.

As for the recovered water, it is stored in large pits above ground until it is disposed of. Roughly 70% of this water can be reused in the fracking process (Maloney, 2012), but due to the high amount of salt brine, chemicals, and radionuclides, the remainder has to be disposed of through other methods. Some of this water is taken to municipal water treatment plants, where it can be turned into a safe water source. The remainder is taken to so-called "deep injection sites", where it is injected into limestone or sandstone formations thousands of feet underground (EPA). The choice of disposal method is based on several factors, such as state regulations and economic viability. Oftentimes it is shipped to another state to be injected, as is often the case with wells in Pennsylvania (NPR).

## Controversy Surrounding Fracking

Due to the high impact fracking has on the environment, the high levels of toxicity in the water used when fracking, and several unknowns about the fracking process, the process is highly controversial. Not only that, but there have been several high profile cases in the news about negative health and environmental impacts of fracking, including cancer, methane leakage into drinking water, and earthquakes from the deep injection wells.

Despite these negatives, it is important to keep in mind that there are benefits to fracking, especially related to the economy. It has been estimated that in some areas affected by fracking, up to between 10,000 and 40,000 jobs are being created. Additionally, fracking causes less air pollution than many other methods of drilling for natural gas. Regulation doesn't often come from the positives of an action though, and the remainder of this paper will explore the more controversial aspects of fracking and the damage it causes.

One major issue regarding fracking is the contamination of drinking water and aquifers near drill sites. In all actuality, there is only one known case of fracking itself affecting a drinking supply. (Several others may exist, but are not known to the public due to court settlements and NDAs (Urbina, 2011)). Instead, drinking water is contaminated due to toxic runoff from flowback containment pits and chemical spills. These sorts of cases are evidenced by incidents such as leaked fluid in Dimock, PA and Parachutte, CO, and drilling failure in Silt, CO.

A second major issue is that of seismic activity caused by the deep waste injection sites. There seems to be a heightened occurrence of seismic activity where these sites are located, presumably due to the injected fluid acting as a lubricating agent that allowed the normally stable faults to slip (Kansas Geological Survey, 2013). One such area that has been affected by these tectonic movements is Youngstown, OH. Located over the large Utica shale formation, there is a great deal of drilling activity taking place there. Of course, with that amount of drilling activity comes a large amount of wastewater being pumped into nearby sandstone formations. In December of 2011, both a 2.7 and 4.0 magnitude earthquake affected the region. Similar findings have been found in regions including Colorado and the Dallas / Ft. Worth area.

## Current Regulation Regarding Fracking

Fracking has been going on for more than 40 years, but surprisingly there is still little regulation on the practice. In fact, under the Bush administration, fracking was allowed to become exempt from many laws. As the technique was not as commonly used at the time as it is today, and because it was not studied in a comprehensive manner, it was granted explicit exclusion from the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Clean Water Act thanks to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Bateman, 2010).

Thanks to the passage of this act, fracking operations are exempt from reporting what chemicals they are using, as well as not being required to monitor and report the usage of these chemicals as it relates to groundwater.

Outside of federal regulation, several states have additional regulation in place. In several states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and others, companies are required to disclose the concentration of chemicals in each of their wells. This regulation does not extend to what the companies consider to be trade secrets though, limiting the effectiveness of these laws. In some cases, these laws extend so far as to prevent the release of trade secrets to physicians, even under an NDA.

## The State of Increased Regulation

Although overall regulation is lax, several states are starting to create more comprehensive laws when it comes to fracking. New York is one such example, where wells are forbidden within 10 miles of municipal water structures. New York is also taking the lead on moratoriums till the results are better known. After the release of an upcoming EPA study (mentioned below), drilling operations must cease for 120 days after the report is released (Throupe et al., 2013).

On the federal level, fracking is being revisited by the EPA in a major study due out later this year. The study is attempting to find out if there is a relationship between fracking and the quality of ground and drinking water. As a major study, consisting of not only water quality readings, but also analysis of well construction and composition of the chemicals used for drilling, it will set the tone for drilling regulation for the foreseeable future.

From a legislative perspective, prospects of additional legislation appear to be moving slowly. Take the FRAC act, for example. This proposed act would require oil and gas companies to disclose all chemicals used in their fracking operations. The act would alse restore the EPA's authority to oversee fracking operations. It has been delayed several times though, and according to Govtrack, chances of it passing are dismal.

## Conclusion

With all the publicity it is getting right now, there is no doubt that fracking is a major movement that is here to stay. When dealing with such large amounts of chemicals though, additional regulation is becoming increasingly necessary to protect against issues such as tainted water supplies and the causal of unwanted seismic activity. Currently legislation varies widely from state to state, and federal oversight is not only absent, but forbidden. For fracking to become a safe and economically viable energy source, additional research and additional regulation are needed.
