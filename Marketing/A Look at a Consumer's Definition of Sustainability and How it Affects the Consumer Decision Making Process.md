## Abstract
In today's world, we are hearing more and more about the importance of environmentalism and being "green". From hybrid and electric cars, to the local food movement, to even household products created with healthier, more natural materials, all the focus is on how to be greener, healthier, and cleanlier.

In an attempt to define just what is the meaning of Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly, I’ve taken a look at a series of journal articles surrounding the topic. In my analysis, I’ve found not a specific definition, but rather proof of just how undefined that topic is. Following is a look at the complex, multi-faceted, and diverse factors which play into what inspires people to see a product as sustainable and what influences their purchasing decisions.

## What Does it Mean to be Environmentally Friendly?
In attempting to determine what it actually means to be environmentally friendly, one first has to acknowledge the incredible range of drivers that influence consumer purchasing behavior when it comes to environmentally friendly products. From the casual consumer to the diehard activist, each subgroup has their own unique motivation.

In attempting to determine a link between all the various subgroups though, it seems to be a scale of sorts between a person's connectedness to nature and the influence of social factors. Not to say one can't have high levels of both, but instead two separate, yet interconnected scales which influence how people perceive and evaluate green products.

Starting with the connectedness to nature, this concept states that people living more environmentally friendly lifestyles are in general connected more closely with nature (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). It is useful in that it illustrates a continuum between how connected people are with their environment and how willing they would be to invest in eco-friendly products. The real value of the connectedness scale isn't simply for defining a consumer though, but for demonstrating that one can strengthening the brand power of a product by attempting to create a sense of connectedness in ways such as packaging and advertising.

The second, and possibly much stronger tie to defining what environmental and sustainable mean is the social factors which tie into one's decision to purchase a green product. In defining sustainable, it is actually the decision of society as a whole which drives people's opinions of what it means to be green (Reser & Bentrupperbäumer, 2005). It is this moral compass which directs how one should act when it comes to acting in an environmentally friendly manner, as opposed to any single body's definition.

Going further into the concept of groupthink in defining sustainability, it is also important to note to role an economy plays into encouraging or discouraging sustainable purchasing decisions. In many well developed countries, it is seen as a moral duty to actively participate in the economy and indulge in consumerism (Soper, 2007). When this collides with the idea of purchasing less and creating less waste to be more environmentally sustainable, it comes down not only to connectedness to nature, but also connectedness to country and the balance between the two.

### Looking Inward
Looking further than just how consumers connect to nature and society, there are several internal factors which are taken into account when one is determining their practices relating to sustainability. First off, we have the concept of eco-localism. Eco-localism is essentially a movement to take a look at the immediate environment and how companies impact it. Factors which these sorts of people take into account include, but of course are not limited to, transportation costs, production processes, and disposal of waste when creating the product. Essentially, these are the people who look at the impact of building the battery packs for a Prius as opposed to just the gas-saving benefits of driving a hybrid. When a company impacts one's local environment, the response is extremely personal and has a huge impact on one's purchasing decisions (Curtis, 2003).

It is also important to note that consumers practice sustainability for internal satisfaction as well. Going back to the social aspect of sustainability, oftentimes people will practice sustainability to look good for their friends and peers (Elliott, 2013). To these people, it is more important to prove that they are environmentally sustainable to others than it is to fulfill their own sense of connectedness. They have determined that demonstrating to others their "worldliness and environmental respect" as opposed to internal satisfaction.

### The Honesty Factor
Looking more to the business side of things now, consumers have been bombarded by green advertising for decades now. After having been faced with so many claims, they have inevitably encountered many lies and false advertising as well (Amine, 2003). Because of this, companies need to be sure to create a sense of honesty to appeal to one's desire to be environmentally friendly. Time and time again, companies have mislabeled their products and created an atmosphere of lies surrounding what it really means to be green. In fact, due to these lies which have surrounded sustainable products for so long, consumers are actually now initially approaching these sorts of products with an air of skepticism (Albayrak, Caber, Moutinho, & Herstein, 2011).

This honesty factor is vital to the health of the green products market, affecting all sorts of people. For example, if one claims that their product is sustainable and environmentally friendly, yet it is later discovered that they are dumping toxic byproducts outside the factory, the eco-localists may be taken aback because it is damaging their immediate environment. Likewise, having a scandal like that being uncovered will create distrust in those who were using the product to appear more socially relevant. Through proper labeling and maintaining honesty and transparency throughout the product lifecycle, one can mitigate the mistrust which can so easily impact "green" products. It’s also been found that proper labeling and certification of sustainable products help to increase the number of consumers who purchase that product for it’s green features. Not many consumers have the time to sort through the potential lies and do their own research, so these sorts of regulations assist with helping them make a sound decision (Young, Hwang, McDonald, & Oates, 2009).

## Impact on Consumer Decision Making
When in comes to marketing sustainable products, the consumer decision making process is an important factor to analyze. Consumers’ choices involve a complex interaction between the sensory properties, environmental, cultural, and contextual influences (Honkanen & Frewer, 2009). It is well established by marketing research that only comparatively few buyers of a given product category are entirely loyal to a single brand, but instead practice multi-brand purchasing over a period of time, selecting apparently randomly among a small subset of tried and tested brands (Foxall & Schrezenmaier, 2003). Rather than extensive in-store processing, simple judgments are made based on perceptions of satisfaction of product performance. This type of decision making are particularly evident for low-involvement products where evaluation occurs during consumption rather than at the point of purchase. (Leong, 1993). Still, impulsive purchases are very lucrative for manufacturers and retailers; they also have stimulated substantial research in recent years. Even more recently, online sales have revitalized this research stream due to the internet creating a new and favorable context for impulsive purchases (Ayadi, Giraud, & Gonzalez, 2013).

Even though the consumers have been routinely bombarded with green products in recent years, it is important to note that the amount of real-world research on the purchase of "green" products is relatively small compared to theoretical and normative research (Baumann & Bragd, 2002). Still, when analyzing how consumers define sustainable products and relating that back to the consumer decision making process, one can infer several ways on how to go about marketing towards the green consumer market.

With the modern tools available to consumers in today's connected world, the first and most important factor to think about comes back to honesty. When a company's reputation can be ruined by something as simple as a 140 character tweet, it is essential to stay true to the claims being made by the company. Nowadays, there are no secrets and at some point the truth will probably come out, potentially damaging the brand for years to come.

Going outside the consumers' perceptions of a company and to the product itself, it's important to create a sense of sustainability to connect to the consumer, especially in terms of packaging. In industrialized western societies, packaging plays an indispensable role in the marketing of consumer goods. As part of the product and distribution mix, packaging performs the functions of quality protection and containment, as well as enhancing efficiency in handling at all stages of the marketing channel. Furthermore, it serves as a vehicle of promotion, especially in the self service environment, where packaging provides the manufacturer with the final opportunity to persuade prospective buyers prior to brand selection (Vandam & Trijp, 1994).

One other important thing to note when creating a marketing plan for sustainable products is the lack of carry-over between various sectors of the sustainable products market (Thøgersen & Ölander, 2003). For instance, if one purchases CFL light bulbs, it may not translate to purchasing organic foods. Thøgersen also found that this lack of tradeoff stems from how ingrained a habit becomes to a person. The more used a person becomes to purchasing a specific product, such as CFL's, the less likely they are to look into what other ways they can go green. Taking this into account, one can't assume that just because they are selling a green product, that people will come. Each product needs to be marketed in a unique and specific way to capture people's attention.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, one can see that the green products field is still open for quite a bit of analysis and interpretation. There are several constants though. When defining what it means to be green, one should concentrate on creating a link to nature and also taking into account the social determinants of using the green product. One should also take into account the integrity of the product and maintaining honesty through marketing.
