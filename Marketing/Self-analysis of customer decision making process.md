# Self-analysis of customer decision making process
*TEM 494 - Reflection Paper 3*

Last weekend, we were out at the fair and had to decide where to eat. Out of all the places where we could decide to eat, we decided that we would go to the vendor selling turkey legs. When analyzing how we came at this decision based on the customer purchase decision process, it followed all five steps laid out in the book.

We first went through problem recognition. We were hungry and we had a massive number of vendors available to us. After coming to terms with the fact that we needed food soon, we began to search for information on where we should go. This step included two sub-steps. First, we had to find out which foods we both enjoyed and had in common. Second, we had to take inventory of all the different vendors that were at the fair. This included evaluating the visuals of the various booths, taking in the smells which drew our attention, and even psychological influences built from past memories of going to the fair and what foods we enjoyed.

After deciding on a problem and taking stock of our options, we had to decide on a place to go. This step is called alternative evaluation and involved sharing opinions, discussing what we were seeing and smelling, and coming up with a place which suited both of our needs. We ended up deciding on going to the vendor selling turkey legs. They were nearby, they smelled incredible, we both liked them, and they were economical enough that we could split one and still be able to afford a funnel cake for dessert.

Postpurchase, we were both extremely satisfied with our decision to get the turkey legs. It appealed to our various criteria we laid out beforehand and the result fell in line with our expectations. It was a great night and the food played a strong part in that.
