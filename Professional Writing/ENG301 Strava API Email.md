Dear Mr. James Barnard,

I would like to propose a change to Strava’s API and data interoperability policies. In recent revisions, the API has been rapidly pulling third-party access and defecating important features. 

Typically in tech companies, API revisions happen on a fairly regular basis and features are added and removed in a timely manner with plenty of advance notice to the API users. In the case of Strava, this change has taken place rapidly and has resulted in many useful third party apps becoming unusable for consumers, not to mention losing the trust of developers. Even as companies like Nike Plus increase their openness, Strava is creating a walled garden.

I am proposing a change to Strava’s policy on data transparency and programming standards to enable support for reintroducing the previously deprecated API features. This will take roughly one year to complete, as much as the software has already been written, it just has to be updated to put back into the new V3 API. The majority of the time after the new API has been completed will be spent reintroducing the features to third party developers and creating documentation on how to use them. There will also have to be a campaign to regain the trust of the third party developers whose products were rendered inoperable by the change.

I personally believe that reintroducing these features will can create a better product overall, and potentially additional revenue streams. Strava is currently getting a lot of traction in the marketplace and at this critical time, it's necessary to take all possible steps to ensure it’s success.

Sincerely,

Drew Watkins
