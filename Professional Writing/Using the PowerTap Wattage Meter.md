## Troubleshooting
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Head unit does not detect PowerTap on initial setup</td>
    <td>The most common cause is that the hub is still in a powered off state. Try spinning the wheel to wake the hub and try again. It that does not work, try replacing the batteries in the hub. Also, ensure your head unit is compatible with ANT+ Sport.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PowerTap no longer connects to head unit</td>
    <td>If the hub was previously paired and no longer connects to the head unit, the batteries may be dead or there may be interference in the signal. Start by attempting to re-pair the head unit with the hub. If the hub is not detected, swap the batteries. Otherwise consult your local PowerTap dealer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PowerTap no longer works after riding in the rain</td>
    <td>Water may have leaked into the hub unit. Open the hub cover and leave the hub in a dry, clean place away from the sun, dust, and extreme temperatures. If it still will not work, try replacing the batteries. Otherwise consult your local PowerTap dealer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PowerTap is displaying erratic numbers</td>
    <td>Recalibration is necessary. Refer to the owner manual of the head unit, as all devices use different recalibration procedures.</td>
