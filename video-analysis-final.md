### Part 1: Background Knowledge (40 points)
#### Critical Thinking (10)
According to Halpern, critical thinking is essentially "the use of those cognitive skills and strategies that increase the probability of a desirable outcome".[^fn-1] He also concludes that the characteristics of critical thinking include the following attributes: 

- **Purposeful** - Thinking should be done with intent and active thought. One must decide to use critical thinking skills.
- **Reasoned** - Critical thinking relies on logic and evaluation as opposed to the alternative animistic thinking associated with simpler mental processes.
- **Goal-directed** - Critical thinking should serve a purpose (different than active thought associated with purposeful thinking)
- **Evaluative** - Critical thinking involves weighing alternatives and using analytics and judgement. It does not rely solely on split-second System 1 thinking.
- **Reflective** - Critical thinking should include a metacognitive process. By reflecting upon the thought process one used, it allows them to improve for the next time they use those techniques.

Essentially, critical thinking involves the use of higher-order mental systems, as opposed to more animalistic and reactionary thinking associated with unintelligent thinking.

An important part of critical thinking is metacognition. As critical thinking tends to include evaluation and reflection upon a decision, it is important to look back and apply metacognitive skills to decide why one thought in the way they did.

#### Decision Making (10)
At it's most basic definition, decision making is the process of weighing a series of choices and coming up with a definitive solution. Decision making can be divided into two systems of thinking, heuristic decision making and rational decision making.[^fn-2]

Heuristic decision making is more basic and animalistic than rational decision making. Commonly referred to as System 1 thinking, heuristic decision making is guided primarily on "gut feeling" and emotion. This sort of thinking is what happens when someone does not apply critical thought to a decision. Because it does not engage these higher order processes, it tends to be extremely quick. A solid example of system 1 thinking is our "Fight or Flight" response.

The second major type of decision making, appropriately referred to as System 2 thinking, or rational decision making, is much more cognitively involved than system 1 thinking. It involves critical thinking processes and weighing all aspects of a decision before acting upon it. As a result of these more involved thought processes, system 2 takes a longer time to process.

It is important to recognize that a given decision may use different systems in different people. As someone becomes more of an expert in a given field, they are able to make decisions quicker and by going with their gut. For example, if a problem were to arise during surgery, an experienced surgeon would immediately know what to do thanks to their heuristic decision making processes, whereas a med student may have to use rational thought to come up with a solution.

#### Problem Solving (10)
According to Jonassen[^fn-3], a problem is “an unknown entity in some situation”. Additionally, a problem must have some sort of social, cultural, or intellectual value. Jonassen then goes on to describe problem solving as a “goal-directed sequence of operations” intended to discover a solution to the problem. The implications of being a goal-directed cognitive process is that there are several given steps to go through the problem solving process.

1. Mental Representation
2. Manipulation of Representation

A mental representation, also problem space or mental model, is how one creates a definition of what a problem is and decides on the necessary tools to solve it. A mental representation takes into account many factors, including: setting up the problem, deciding what steps to take to solve the problem, and deciding what strategies to use in solving the problem. This is also the stage where the problem in analyzed to come up with a concrete set of terms and definitions surrounding the problem. All these factors contribute towards allowing one to start manipulating a problem space and solve the problem.

As one begins to solve the problem, another sub-series of events takes place. This is called the IDEAL model, and is used for solving the vast majority of problems. 

1. *Identify* potential problems
2. *Define* and represent the problem
3. *Explore* possible strategies and procedures to solve the problem
4. Apply *Acton* towards those strategies
5. *Look back* and evaluate the implemented solution to the problem

When going through the problem solving process, it is also smart to consider the *structure* of the problem at hand. The structure of the problem is related to a problem's complexity and how many components of a problem are visible. In a well structured problem, all inputs are visible and the output is a specific goal. Math problems are almost always a well-structured problem. As for an ill-structured problem, they require more creative thought and subjective thinking, as the variables and actions are not known.

#### Creativity (10)
Creativity is basically defined as the ability to generate ideas which are diverse, uncommon, and detailed. Thanks to Sternberg's research[^fn-4], this has now been further defined into various theories of creativity. Of particular note is the "Investment Theory of Creativity". The investment theory states that people “invest” in ideas that unknown or out of favor and develop the potential of those ideas. Simplified, people "buy low" and "sell high".

Part of the investment theory of creativity involved the idea of "confluence", or a set of several various cognitive skills which contribute to creativity. These include:

- Intellectual skills: One's ability to think intelligently and apply the powers of reasoning and deduction
- Knowledge - The factual knowledge that one actually knows
- Ways of thinking - Does one prefer puzzles and cognitive engagement? Having this tendency helps people to naturally think creatively
- Personality and dispositions - Someone who easily overcomes obstacles and readily takes risks has a tendency to be more creative.
- Motivation - Does someone have passion for the field they are working in?
- Environmental factors - What resources does one have at their disposal? When one has access to more resources to lean on, they tend to come up with more creative ideas.

Additionally, some of these skills can support a deficit in another. For example, if one is extremely motivated to solve a problem, it can make up for a lack of general knowledge in that domain.

As creativity is dependant upon others viewing an idea as novel and important, an idea's level of creativity can also depend upon the culture and time period in which it was introduced. For example, an abstract painting now may be artful and unique, but the style is nowhere near as creative as it was in the days of Van Gogh. Another example is that a talented software developer would have no use in the era of the cave-man. 

Finally, as creativity is considered to change what already exists in a new and novel way, it is considered to "propel" an idea along a specific path. Ideas may:

1. Accept current paradigms and extend them
2. Reject current paradigms and replace them with a new idea
3. Synthesize current paradigms and combines or reimagines how they work together.

### Part 2: Analysis of the “Effective Thinking” Video (25 points)

1. **Provide the URL the video. (1)**
http://vimeo.com/111659388

2. **Summarize the video. What are the major ideas or events shown in the video? Provide sufficient detail that a reader can understand what is occurring even if they have not seen the video. (2)**
As Tempe grows to include more corporate offices and high-rise residences, Mill Avenue is in the process of rebranding to be Downtown Tempe. Reasons for this are many, but at it's simplest, it is about shedding the image of being a college party town and transitioning to become an economic hub for young adults and young families.

	Downtown Tempe's marketing strategy covers a wide range of mediums, from a Twitter campaign, to partnerships with local businesses, to a video advertising campaign. Their video campaign, in particular, is of great interest from an intelligence standpoint. The video exists purely from the standpoint of making people want to visit or live in Tempe. It's gist is that it goes through a number of images of people having fun in Tempe or sights around Downtown Tempe. Despite appealing solely to one's sense of ethos, there was a great deal of thought behind the video. Looking at their promotional video from a meta point of view, why did they do this? How will we benefit as a community?

3. **Briefly state why you chose this video as an example. Why do you feel the behaviors in the video demonstrate effective thinking? (2)**
The reasoning behind this video demonstrate effective thinking because the campaign to remarket Mill to become Downtown Tempe makes sense. It is being done at the right time, as Tempe is growing and attracting more young professionals. The thought processes behind the rebranding have taken into account quite a bit of rational thought, and include all shareholders in the project, from businesses to residents.

4. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate critical thinking? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the video exhibit effective critical thinking. (5)**
As stated previously, critical thinking is exhibited through many avenues. The city of Tempe's decision to rebrand the Mill Avenue District exhibits all of these areas of thinking (sans reflective, as the project has yet to be fully implemented). They are:
	- Purposeful - The city of Tempe did not arbitrarily decide to begin rebranding. Instead, they knew that the State Farm development and other new businesses in the area near, but not on, Mill Ave, would be bringing in an influx of jobs and city officials wanted to appeal to them.
	- Evaluative - The branding was well thought out after evaluating all the qualities Tempe possesses. According to an article in the [State Press][5], talking to community members and small business owners was a large part of the rebranding project. Taking into account the party scene on Mill, the growing economic district on Rio Salado, the recreation opportunities at Tempe Town Lake, and the research qualities of being so close to ASU, Downtown Tempe evaluated all they had to offer and create a brand which represents that.
	- Reasoned - Tempe considered all customer segments in the video, while setting a vision for the area. City officials then all came to the table and deliberated about the direction in which to head the city.
	- Goal-Directed - Tempe has a goal for how the want to transition Tempe from a party town to a hip urban environment. According to Kate Borders, president of the Downtown Tempe Authority, "“We want to change the way everyone views Tempe, It’s not just Mill Avenue. We want to appeal to everyone, including college students.” Clearly, the city has ideas which have a specific goal in mind and they have thought critically about how to achieve that goal.

5. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate decision making? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the video exhibit effective decision making. (5)**
As stated in the critical thinking section, the process of rebranding Tempe was reasoned, analytical, and deliberative. Rebranding the Mill Avenue District into Downtown Tempe was absolutely a System 2-oriented decision. They took the time to weigh all aspects of the decision and all shareholders involved. Rebranding Tempe's economic district was in no way a "gut" decision, but instead relied upon a long, drawn-out process of critical thinking and deliberation.

6. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate problem solving? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the videos exhibit effective problem solving. (5)**
Tempe was being faced with a problem, that of a changing role from college town to economic hub. The [Arizona Republic][6] sums this up best:
>Tempe's central location between Phoenix and larger suburbs and proximity to major freeways, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and the commerce and recreation at Town Lake have primed downtown for economic recovery. Downtown has developed into an expanding urban center, shedding any past resemblance to the traditional town squares found in smaller cities.

	Clearly there was an impasse with social and cultural significance which the City of Tempe had to consider. The City of Tempe's decision to rebrand Tempe fits neatly into the IDEAL model:
	1. **Identify** - The face of Tempe's economic center is changing. How should we adapt?
	2. **Define** - We need to reorient the Mill Avenue District during this time of growth. Our key goals are to move past our vision of being a "college town" and to represent all businesses in the area, not just those on Mill Avenue.
	3. **Explore** - Before rebranding, the Mill Avenue District took the time to explore all options and talk to local businesses and stakeholders to see the direction they wished to move in.
	4. **Action** - The Downtown Tempe Authority decided that the best way to move forward was to rename the Mill Avenue District to be Downtown Tempe and remarket it as a space for young adults and families, in addition to college students.
	5. **Look Back** - As the transition further progresses, the Downtown Tempe Authority will look back and evaluate whether they were successful in rebranding their economic hub.

7. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate creativity or transfer? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the videos exhibit effective creativity or transfer. (5)**
The project of redefining how Tempe is viewed is a perfect example of the Investment Theory of Creativity. The transition from college town to economic hub is definitely a case of "buy low, sell high". Additionally, this project is propelling Tempe forward by redefining it, following the path of *redirection*. In this model of redefinition, the old idea of a college town is being replaced with a new idea of a business hub, this is without completely severing ties to the roots of what makes Tempe, *Tempe*.

	The marketing to rebrand the Mill Avenue District is also extremely creative. Tempe is really focusing on appealing to the public's emotional side. They are instilling pride in the residents by showcasing the high points of Tempe as opposed to just explaining why they are making the changes they are implementing. This is able to be seen in multiple domains, such as the aforementioned video and with the [#TempeRising][twitter] Twitter campaign.

### Part 3: Analysis of the “Ineffective Thinking” Video (25 points)

1. **Provide the URL the video. (1)**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=137wIJhs2Vo (first minute)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IuYyQKoAnY (first 30 seconds)

2. **Summarize the video. What are the major ideas or events shown in the video? Provide sufficient detail that a reader can understand what is occurring even if they have not seen the video. (2)**
The "ineffective thinking" videos I chose are a couple of guys who decide to go muddin' in a Nissan Altima. The first time, they get stuck. They then try again (see second video), though without any analysis of the first attempt. This time, they end up completely flooding the engine and destroying the bumper, basically totalling the car.

3. **Briefly state why you chose this video as an example. Why do you feel the behaviors in the video demonstrate ineffective thinking? (2)**
The behaviors in this video demonstrate ineffective thinking because the guys trying to take the Altima through mud do not reflect upon their first attempt before going through with the second attempt. They also do not take into account their knowledge of physics or other "intelligent" thinking skills.

4. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate uncritical thinking? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the video exhibit uncritical thinking. (5)**
The people in this video had the goal of getting the Altima through the mud pit, but they did not evaluate the situation before trying, reason through the problem at hand, or display purposeful thought, or reflected on what went wrong the first time before trying a second attempt. 

5. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate poor decision making? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the video exhibit poor decision making. (5)**
The only major decision made was the decision to go faster the second attempt. This was also made using system 1 thinking techniques. They did not evaluate the side effects of going faster, such as the impact force of the car hitting the water.

	The decision to take the Alima through the mud in the first place was also a decision, but not one that was shown on the video.

6. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate poor problem solving? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the videos exhibit poor problem solving. (5)**
The only problem they encountered in the video was how to get the Altima unstuck from the mud pit. It can be argued that using the Jeep to get the Alitma unstuck could be considered a solid solution to the problem at hand, and it is, but when you grow up playing with vehicles and mud, it is almost a heuristic to get a truck to get another vehicle unstuck. This decision was very much a system 1 decision, thus did not display any critical thinking skills. 

7. **In what ways does your chosen video demonstrate a lack of creativity or transfer? Refer to the principles of critical thinking to explain how the behaviors shown in the videos exhibit a lack of creativity or transfer. (5)**
The idea of taking an Altima muddin' is a creative thought, using a tool, in this case a vehicle, for something other than was it was made to do, but they exhibited no motivation to make it succeed.

	Additionally, on the second attempt, there was no account for knowledge of basic physics, reflection on why the first attempt failed, or manipulation of the environment to alter approach angles, etc. and make the stunt successful.
